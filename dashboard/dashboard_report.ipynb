    "### 1. Introduction\n",
    "The real-time e-commerce dashboard provides a comprehensive view of key metrics and campaign performances for better monitoring and decision-making. By visualizing metrics such as total sales, revenue, and customer transactions, the dashboard supports an in-depth understanding of e-commerce performance over time. This report outlines the feature's implementation, discusses the potential benefits it offers to e-commerce businesses, and highlights challenges encountered during the development process.\n",

    "### 2. Implementation\n",
    "#### Key Features Implemented\n",
    "**Key Sales Metrics**: Displays total sales, revenue, transactions, customer count, and average customer lifetime value (CLV) on a yearly basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**At-Risk Customers Data**: Allows for at-risk customers every year to be identified so that targeted marketing strategies can be used for these customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Campaign Performance Analysis**: Visualizations of yearly campaign-driven growth rates, average order values (AOV), revenue, and transaction counts to assess the effectiveness of each campaign.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ROI and Cost Analysis**: Tracks the return on investment (ROI) across various marketing channels (Instagram, Physical, Radio, TV, TikTok, YouTube) for selected campaigns. The real-time component allows the user to analyze yearly data trends.\n",
    "Technologies Used:\n",

    "#### Technologies Used\n",
    "We integrated our code with Streamlit, which is an open-source Python framework for creating web apps, enabling real-time updates with our database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Potential Benefits\n",
    "The dashboard allows business stakeholders to quickly understand overall performance and dive into specifics of each campaign. This enables proactive adjustments to campaigns, inventory management, and other key business processes. With ROI analysis for each marketing channel, the dashboard identifies the most effective channels, helping to reallocate marketing budgets toward channels that drive the most revenue for subsequent years. By identifying at-risk customers from the dashboard, business stakeholders can implement targeted promotions for this group of customers, thus improving customer retention and lifetime value. Campaign performance insights for events such as Christmas and Easter allow for seasonally focused marketing strategies, maximizing impact during peak shopping periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Challenges Encountered\n",
    "One major challenge was integrating data from various files. We had to import the relevant functions from multiple Python files into a single file for the dashboard, requiring careful coordination to avoid redundant imports and conflicts. Ensuring that data from each file aligned correctly also involved thorough testing and validation. Determining the most relevant metrics and visualizations was also challenging as we had to ensure the dashboardâ€™s value for business stakeholders. We carefully analyzed business requirements to select meaningful data points and visual representations, ensuring that the insights provided would be actionable. Lastly, optimizing the layout and formatting was also challenging as the dashboard has to be clear and accessible. We had to ensure efficient formatting to allow stakeholders to interpret insights quickly without getting overwhelmed by data. \n",
